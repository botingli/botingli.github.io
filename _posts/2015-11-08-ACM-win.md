## Third place in our region!

We solved 4 problems in total and I solved 2 hard problems alone! Both problems have difficulty rating higher than 7.5!

Most dramatically, my solution to one problems was accepted in the very last minute! This made our team beat big insitutions like UK or UL, even some teams from UIUC or Uchicago! 

### We even received a congradulation letter from President Rush!
