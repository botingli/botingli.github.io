##This is my first Post!

I spend a lot of time research, build, and custom this site, which is based on the hypster theme.
Differnent from using blogs provided by other companies, I have absolute freedom here.

I will update this as a programming blog, and write :
*Things I learned in class
*Projects I have done. Alone or with others.
*Other cool things I find.

I don't know how often I could update this because I am going to be very busy this year, but let's see!
